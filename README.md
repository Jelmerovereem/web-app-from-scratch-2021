## Getting started

This project doesn't use any bundlers or dev servers. I would advice you to install [Browsersync](https://www.npmjs.com/package/browser-sync) to serve the web content in this project. You install Browsersync either through [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) or any other NPM package manager of choice with global installation functionality.

```shell
$ npm install --global browser-sync || yarn global add browser-sync
```

Then proceed to clone this repository.

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/Jelmerovereem/web-app-from-scratch-2021
$ cd web-app
$ browser-sync -w -s -p 5000 # Starts a browser-sync server on port 5000 that watches for file changes in the current directory
```
